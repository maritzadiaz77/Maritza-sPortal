        <h3>Hi, I'm Maritza!</h3>
        <p>
          Welcome to my portal! Here you'll see that I'm a small town girl from
          central valley California. My current role is as a UC Berkeley
          extentsion bootcamp student.
        </p>
        <p>
          These days, my time is spent researching and practicing code. I enjoy
          building up my skill set for coding beacause I strive to be a full
          stack developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I am seperated from my computer, you'll see me at art museums,
          petting my dog, reading, playing videogames, and hiking trails around
          the United states wherever I can.
        </p>
