# Portfolio-Maritza's Portal

## Description
I created a website for this career and it contains an about me section detailing who I am as a person. Anyone who goes to my website can see who I am outside of software development and also get to know me through the work examples that I provided on my site. The website that I created is called "Maritza's Portal" and all the way at the bottom of the site, it contains links to contact me and shows my github and my email. In this project, I learned how to make a simple and concise functional website with functional links.
